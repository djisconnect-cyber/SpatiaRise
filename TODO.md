# TODO for Adding Red Semi-Transparent Effect on Canvas During Wall Reveal After Losing

- [x] Modify the render() function in maze-game.js to add a red semi-transparent overlay (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)) over the entire canvas during the 'revealing' game state, which occurs after the player hits a wall and loses.
- [x] Change the overlay to a radial gradient: dark red at the edges, transparent in the center.
